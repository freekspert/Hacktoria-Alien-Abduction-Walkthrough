So latest Hacktoria contract, attempted whilst abroad on holiday, so that was interesting

flagfile needed a specific URL to unlock

The story revolved around a UFO sighting and the image provided was the basis for the investigation along with some information around date and time for sighting

Using the information and a google search that was partly generic and partly specific (broomfield CO "UFO") lead to a ufo sighting webbsite https://nuforc.org/webreports/ndxlCO.html

from this the top sighting was dated as per the instructions and clicking ont he link gave the URL of https://nuforc.org/webreports/reports/175/S175200.html

this was submitted to the flagfile and popped the card
